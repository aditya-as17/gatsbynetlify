Put simply, stock-picking means investing in the stocks you think will outperform the market. It’s a strategy used by both DIY investors and those in fund management. Remember, though, that fund managers are supported by a small army of analysts.
However in reality they will charge a bounty and that will yield you nothing.

To decide whether a stock is a good investment opportunity, stock pickers assess factors such as the company’s price, dividend yield, earnings forecasts, growth opportunities, and market dynamics.

The opposite of stock picking is index investing, where investors place money in funds that track an index, like the FTSE 100 or S&P 500.
