# Economics of Open Source

Open source is powering much of the computing around us. Right from your favorite web technologies viz. React, Node or RubyonRails to the statistical/mathematical 
calculations via ‘dplyr’ or ‘matplotlib’ or ‘scipy’ etc are open source and dependent on the community for their progress and relevance. Even erstwhile secrecy 
and proprietary freaks like the investment banks, Govt, space agencies too have joined the open source bandwagon. Our beloved teachers and friends i.e. Google, 
Youtube, Facebook, Instagram etc. have been built on top of an open stack. 

The question arises, ‘If open source is free, then how do its developers get paid. Don’t they have mutual fund SIP, and HDFC home loan emi to pay and 
doordash/swiggy/zomato bills to take care of ?’

## Who are these developers and how do they make money?

Since the rise of linux in early 2000s, engineers working in corporations like IBM, Microsoft, Google have been dabbling around with side projects in their free 
time and to test their idea, the hosted it for free, generally to solve their own programming difficulties. Community served as the validation for their idea. 
The other developers countering similar problems, would devote their time too. **Thus, you have a validated product and a customer base and a freemium business model
where basic services are free.**

Collaboration became easier with the rise of Github and developers could easily devote their weekends for the open source projects. Companies too started
diverting resources for the maintenance of open source projects as a means to give back to the community and also to ensure that the software that they are 
dependent on, is not orphaned by the hobbyist developers.

Then GitHub tip, Patreon, Paypal then bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies made it easy to support open source developers by grants and monthly contributions. 
Now usage of open libraries have become huge so that the developers have consulting opportunities too to make money. 

## Motivation for open source

As it must be clear by now that the primary motivation for contributing to open source has never been money but the speed with which it got improvements, 
timely rollouts, new features made it vital for companies to survive and thus the money followed the developers.

At its core, open source is more about having the source code open which can be audited and updated by the community so that the users are never dependent 
on existence of one particular company but the whole community itself. One company can go out of business not the entire community. 

**This principle has been at the core of development of cryptocurrency so that money does not become a privilege of one central authority rather the whole 
community.**
