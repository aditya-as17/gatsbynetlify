If a plane deviates 1 degree off its course, it misses its target destination by 1 mile for every 60 miles it flies. Further you go, further away from the destination it gets. Like every thing, mistakes compound too. This is true in life as well. So, every once in a while, it's a great idea to review, are you on the right path.

1. Am I happy doing what I am doing right now? 
2. What would I do if no one was watching and success was inevitable in it?
3. What would I NOT do if I knew for sure it would fail?
4. What would I do EVEN if I knew it was going to fail.
5. What am I doing right now because I think I SHOULD do it?
6. Looking back at last week how much of my day was spent working on things I actively enjoyed?
7. How'd that compare to the week before?

When done repeatedly, week over week, its becomes really hard to deviate from your destination.
