If a plane deviates 1 degree off its course, it misses its target destination by 1 mile for every 60 miles it flies. Further you go, further away from the destination it gets. Like every thing, mistakes compound too. This is true in life as well. So, every once in a while, it's a great idea to review, are you on the right path.

These questions I use to review, If I am running on the right track.

1. What am I doing right now, does it make long term sense?
2. Am I enjoying what I do?
  a. If yes, then can it still take me to my goal?
  b. If no, then is it due to the pain of discipline or the pain of uselessness.
  c. If it is useless, can i delete it completely?
3. What would I do for free, because I enjoy doing it?
4. What would I do EVEN if I know it will fail?
5. What would I do if no one was watching and success was inevitable in it?
6. How much of my day is spent, in doing things that make long term sense?
7. What are the areas where I am getting distracted? How much of that distraction may be useful in future?
8. Compared to last week, what I think about my progress? Have I improved? If not, then, Was it due to events beyond my control?

The important part about this exercise that you should be brutally honest with yourself. If there is even a little bit of comforting lie, it can wreck us in the long run. However, the good part is, when done repeatedly, week over week, its becomes really hard to deviate from your destination, because You cannot run away from yourself for long. And that is when, progress happens.
