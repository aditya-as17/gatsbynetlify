Crypto market has been hot with media coverage for quite some time. With everyone talking about it, giving their verdicts, predicting the future, I too joined the bandwagon of analysis minus the noise.

Money solved our problem of exchange and made our life easier but it has been the sole pejorative of the administrators to issue it. Earlier the kings, then in the democratic world, central banks printed money which was used by everyone. But on 22 May 2010, history was made when Laszlo Hanyecz made the first real-world transaction by buying two pizzas in Jacksonville, Florida, for 10,000 BTC. Why it was historic because bitcoin was not issued by Fed Reserve but by a private individual (or individuals) Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then cryptocurrencies have come a long way.

Now, there are multiple cryptocurrency exchanges around the world trading in billions of dollars in volume, cryptos are as liquid as the national currency in New York, San Francisco, Vancouver, London and other Technopolis. If the job of money is medium of exchange, cryptos are doing very well.

But except the technologically advanced cities and tech geeks, people are still sceptical about it being a store of value as it is extremely volatile. And since it is not used widely, no chance of it being a unit of account anytime soon.

So, in this essay, we will look if cryptocurrency can be classified as money, why/why not, what are the pitfalls and risks and what future does it hold. There are more than 3000 cryptocurrencies but here we will talk about bitcoin and ethereum as bitcoin has more than 50% of the market share and ethereum is the largest blockchain platform.

## What is cryptocurrency

A cryptocurrency is a peer-to-peer application that stores its transactions on a public blockchain and uses a consensus mechanism to validate and process transactions. A public blockchain is nothing but a distributed ledger, in which transactions are stored in blocks and publicly accessible to all stakeholders. Think of distributed ledger as the ledger to which every stakeholder has access. The blocks are cryptographically linked in a temporal order so that a block always has only one predecessor, linked together as a chain.

A cryptocurrency is a peer-to-peer application, means users can transact without the need for an intermediary unlike the traditional model where communication is usually to and from a central server. Everybody has the same rights and thus everyone is allowed to join the application and to read and write new transactions. But this has risk of fraud and so to overcome this, consensus mechanisms exist, meaning the transactions have to be verified by other participants which makes it fraud proof.

These consensus mechanisms, ensure that all participants agree on what transactions have been executed. Furthermore, the consensus mechanism is used to create economic incentives to participate in validating transactions, and a consensus mechanism is implemented in a way that economically motivates participants to align with the rules of the applications. Consensus mechanisms used are Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. Proof of work is solving a mathematical puzzle to add a block which would take 51% of the computing power of the network. In the same manner, proof of stake requires coins instead of computing power of the network.

## Cryptocurrency as money or asset

Cryptocurrencies differ from traditional fiat money in their decentralisation and independence from authorities and intermediaries. But using it as money requires ease of use, widespread acceptance to trade large number of goods or just a store of value. All these qualities are present in fiat money. You can use cash or transact through mobile/cards, since backed by central banks so widespread acceptance and value remains fairly constant (except for the inflation eating value).

But for cryptos, perceptions foster or hinder the use of cryptocurrency as money. If I perceive it secure, easy to use, I'll use it. If I am sceptical, I will not use it despite it having all the benefits. People have been flogging to bitcoins because of hype around it in social media and people are buying and using it in pursuit of speculative profits only not as a media of exchange.

Research shows that even if individuals own cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrencies are meant to be used as investments and individuals resist using cryptocurrency as money. The biggest concern for it being too volatile. At present, digital currencies are used by relatively few people. For these people, digital currencies are primarily viewed as stores of value — albeit with significant volatility in their valuations. like people buy house, gold as a store of value, bitcoin has joined the same club.

Unit of account is the most reliable measure of whether a crypto is catching up as money. At present, there is little evidence of digital currencies being used as units of account. Although many vendors in US and EU cities have started accepting cryptos but value recorded is in dollar/euro/pound terms and then converted to crypto. This is why it is seen only as an investment not a replacement to traditional money.

Since no central authority stands behind cryptos for guarantee, an opinion about their future demand should largely rest on possibility about their future use as media of exchange and a belief that they will continue to remain in demand even in the future.

Even in the electronic form, fiat money is backed by physical currency claim for whatever credit debit takes place. In contrast to fiat money such as banknotes or bank deposits, digital currencies are not backed by guarantee of central bank or any other authority. In this respect, they can therefore be thought of as a type of commodity like gold or silver.

## Risks associated with It being the money

Most digital currencies have a fixed supply. Although that is not a rule but the norm. Bitcoin has maximum supply of 21 million BTC. Ethereum, though has unlimited supply but will cap maximum coins to 120 million a year to avoid concentration of coins with powerful CPUs(puzzles become harder with every block mined which use significant computing resources) and also to increase its value with limited availability. In addition to making it extremely unlikely that a digital currency, as currently designed, will achieve widespread usage in the long run, a fixed money supply may also harm the macroeconomy: it could contribute to deflation in the prices of goods and services, and in wages. And importantly, the inability of the money supply to vary in response to demand would likely cause greater volatility in prices and real activity.

Although BTC/ETH do not have that kind of impact as a currency but as an asset class it can be dangerous. A price crash in assets to which households, companies or financial institutions had large enough exposures could lead to financial distress. Exposure to housing loans CDO led bear stearns to fail, lehmann brothers to go bankrupt and merril lynch to merge with Bank of America in 2008 financial crisis. Central banks cannot let systemically important institutions have this kind of exposure as it can wreck the whole economy.

## Final Verdict

Something to be considered as money, it should have 3 characteristics :

1. **Store of value** means an asset or commodity that can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged in the future and it will not decay.
2. **Media of exchange** that can be accepted in return for goods and services
3. **Unit of account** where goods and services are measured in those terms, like I sold you soda worth $1.50

There are many assets that people view as stores of value like houses, gold but do not use as media of exchange. By comparison, one asset can be a media of exchange if at least two people (as parties to a transaction) consider it as a store of value, at least temporarily. Finally, for an asset to be considered a unit of account, it must be able to be used as a medium of exchange across a variety of goods and services between several people and as such represents a form of co-ordination across society. Therefore, economists consider the operation as a unit of account to be the most important characteristic of money.

**At present, however, digital currencies fulfil the roles of money only to some extent and only for a small number of people, who are tech-savvy, rich and live in cities like New York, London. They are likely at present to regularly serve all three purposes for perhaps only a few thousand people worldwide, that too, along with fiat money, not standalone, full-fledged alternative to the central bank issued money.

Research about an individual’s adoption or use of cryptocurrency might be oversimplified or misleading.

## Future Developments

Now, central banks around the world are keen on riding the digital currency wave primarily because primarily they do not want to get disrupted and second the lower cost of transaction and faster speed of transfers will benefit the country as well. However, they will not be based on distributed ledgers but centralised and central banks will have sole rights to mine. It can have massive technical efficiency because payments will be settled in real time unlike today where it has to cleared by clearing houses. China has already rolled out its ‘digital yuan’ program. Other countries too have been experimenting with the idea as CBDC has the potential to eliminate paper currency which can save tax evasion and illegal activities as CBDC can be tracked.

Although the benefits are immense but it is still too early to say anything with convection, how it will affect interest rates, savings, monetary policy and other goals desired out of CBDC.
