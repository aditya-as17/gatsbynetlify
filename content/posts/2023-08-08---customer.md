> write about what is your ideal customer profile,

There’s a principle I like to follow in education businesses:

Your customer should be 90% sold before they get anywhere near a sales page.

If you do this, then the sales page is no more than a formality…

You have no need for sales calls…

Your business runs like a well-oiled machine…

And you can get back to that novel you’re trying to finish, while sipping on your Oat Latte by the beach.

(Ok, maybe that’s just me.)

Anyway…

How do you get people 90% sold before they see a sales page?

By using a content framework.

That’s how.

In your content framework, you specify all the things your customer needs to know to be ready to buy from you.

Here’s ours…

StoryLearning Content Framework:

What is this and how is it different?
What do I get from you?
Where did it come from? (Origin story)
Who is this NOT for?
Problem and solution
How does it work?
Why should I listen?
Logical urgency
Proof, testimonials, case studies
Then, when you’ve got this content framework, you pepper your content (blogs, emails, videos, ads) with this stuff on a regular basis.

That way, anyone who consumes your content will (gradually, over time) have all their doubts satisfied, and be screaming:

“Will you _please _tell me how I can give you money?”

Neat, huh?
