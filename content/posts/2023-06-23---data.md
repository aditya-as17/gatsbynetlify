## Data Driven Organization :
When we say data-driven, we’re talking about companies that operationalize data. We’re talking about businesspeople who use data to change the way they work right now and later this afternoon, who consult data before developing new products, speaking to customers, or designing an ad campaign. We were talking about workers who wake up every morning and use data to tune their actions throughout the day.

It requires single source of data and single data dictionary so that there’s absolute truth not relative truth. For Example - The data team at Warby Parker isn’t sitting in an ivory tower using algorithms to forecast the company’s revenue five years from today. Rather, these expert individuals roam the company, ensuring that employee access to important data remains unfettered and that conversations using data are free-flowing and productive. They continuously remove friction that might prevent employees from asking and answering the questions vital to decision making.

## **Hubspot Sales Model**

HubSpot is a $1.5 billion iconoclast of a company. Founded in 2006 at MIT by Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, HubSpot created the inbound marketing wave, and its orange logo is synonymous with efficient content marketing and customer acquisition, particularly for small-to-medium businesses. Since its founding, HubSpot has become the third most popular marketing automation software by market share. In 2015, the company generated more than $150 million in revenue. To sustain the business’s 50 percent annual revenue growth rate, the sales team employs a quantitative promotion plan for its salespeople, removing any element of personal judgment. HubSpot salespeople are measured on five metrics, in addition to bookings.

1. **Pipeline size**: HubSpot measures pipeline size by the number of contacts a customer manages. Today, pricing varies between $200 per month to $2,400 per month, depending on the size of the customer’s customer database.
2. **Deal velocity**: Each salesperson is assigned a quota that varies with his region, his experience, and his industry. The combination of these three factors influences the average value of a customer a salesperson pursues. Deal velocity divides the total quota by the average value of a customer, allowing the salesperson to determine the number of customers he must close each week in order to attain his quota.
3. **Cash collection characteristics**: Many customers buy a 12-month subscription for HubSpot software. Some customers are willing to pay for all 12 months at sign-up. The more a customer is willing to pay at the beginning of the contract, the more cash HubSpot has to fuel its growth over the subsequent 12 months, so salespeople are incentivized to structure contracts with annual prepay.
4. **Quota attainment rate**: The quota attainment rate is the ratio of currently retired quota to target quota. Retired quota is the total value of all new contracts in the current quarter.
5. **Customer retention**: Inevitably, some HubSpot customers who have signed a contract will decide not to renew their contract in one year. In contrast, other customers, the valuable ones, increase their spend over time as they add more and more contacts to their HubSpot database. Customer retention measures the value of a cohort of customers over time. If the salesperson is selecting his target customers well, the customers he closed last year should be paying more in aggregate this year, implying that they are happy with the software and are succeeding with it. The contrary may also be true: If the sales[1]person is selling to customers for whom the product is not a good fit, many of them will no longer renew the software or will pay less for it in the future.

Obviously, this cocktail of metrics isn’t a simple formula for sales[1]people to understand and calculate themselves. So, the sales opera[1]tions team has built an embedded dashboard within Salesforce that displays these crucial metrics. Salespeople can access their dashboard whenever they like to see precisely where they are at any point in time during the quarter relative to their goal. HubSpot has found that this consistent feedback and quantita[1]tive measurement enable sales leaders to coach the sales team to close exactly the customers who will ultimately be successful with HubSpot’s software and will continue to drive its sensational growth.

## **Scaling sales team with data**

As new salespeople join the team, how fast are they ramping? How quickly does a new account executive begin to close customers and attain his full quota?

As new salespeople join a business, they are provided a ramp time, a period to learn the sales processes, learn the product, study the typical objections, and develop their own techniques to succeed. At the beginning of the ramp, the salespeople are responsible for 25 percent of their full quota. As they learn the company’s product and sales motions, this quota responsibility ramps to 100 percent. Ramp times vary depending on the value of the product and the length of the sales cycle.

Salespeople typically come in one of two varieties. Inside sales representatives close customers primarily through the telephone. They work inside the business. Typically, inside salespeople ramp within one to three quarters. Outside salespeople, or field salespeople, travel quite a bit and spend the bulk of their time outside their office. In the software world, inside sales quotas vary from $400,000 to $1.2 million. Outside sales representatives tend to carry quotas of $1 million to $2.5 million, though sometimes they can close substantially more business. Larger contracts often imply elongated sales cycles spanning 6 to 12 months. To evaluate the performance of field salespeople, sales managers often require more time, so field ramp times range from 6 to 12 months.

As salespeople enter and exit the organization, a sales manager must manage each individual’s performance to maximize the success of the organization. At any given time, some salespeople might be ramping, others may have just been promoted and assigned a higher quota, and still others may have moved from inside to field. The amount of business a sales team books relative to their goal, quota targets and quota retirement, will often change daily.

In Looker’s case, the ramp period for both inside and outside salespeople extends six months, or two quarters. For each rep, the first box, which spans that two-quarter ramp period, indicates when the rep started. During this six-month ramp time, the reps have a smaller target quota and the rep’s performance relative to that target is contained within the box. A 100 percent means the sales[1]person booked exactly his quota. Less than 100 percent implies he missed his number; greater than 100 percent means he exceeded his target quota.

![sales-quota(looker).png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3faa9952-c52b-416c-9933-ce8cdab709a8/sales-quota(looker).png)

Each subsequent box in a rep’s role indicates how the rep’s quota attainment progresses with time and whether or not the rep is con[1]sistently attaining quota. The last column on the right indicates the pipeline-to-quota ratio, which divides the total value of the rep’s qualified pipeline by the target quota for the period. This is a leading indicator of whether the salesperson will be able to attain his quota in the current period.

Ideally, the booking-to-quota ratio should be between four and five. If a company’s lead-to-close rate is 20 percent—in other words, if one in five leads converts to a customer—the pipeline-to-quota ratio should be at least five, or 1/20. If the close rate is 25 percent, the target pipeline-to-quota ratio should be four. The better the close rate, the smaller the ratio needs to be in order for reps to consistently attain quota.

**Net Promoter Score**

NPS is used to measure customer loyalty. It is measured on a scale from +100 to –100 and is gathered by send[1]ing out a survey to customers asking each one, “How likely are you to recommend this product to a friend or colleague?” The recipient answers on a scale from 1 to 10. Respondents who mark 9 or 10 on the survey are Promoters. Those who mark 0 to 6 are Detractors. The remainder are dubbed Passives. The NPS is calculated by subtracting the number of Promoters from Detractors.

At the bottom of the heap, companies like Time Warner Cable register −20 NPS. In 2015, Costco recorded the highest NPS of all Fortune 500 companies, at 79.13 The typical software company receives an NPS of 29, meaning there are only slightly more Promoters than Detractors.14 But at its peak, Zendesk charted an NPS of 90! For every one detractor of Zendesk, there were nine other people recommending it to friends and colleagues.

Best-in-class NPS scores meaningfully reduce the cost to acquire customers, greasing the marketing engine and powering revenue growth. This hugely positive force has propelled the company’s growth and enabled it to scale across borders quickly. Before Zendesk had an office or a single employee in Brazil, it counted a thousand customers, all from word of mouth. And the customer base was growing at 300 percent annually.

Unlike many companies who use NPS to survey existing customers, Zendesk polls its users at three different points during the sales cycle: (1) immediately after signing up; (2) a few days after signing up as a customer, potentially having spoken to salesperson, and beginning to pay for the service; and (3) sometime after the customer has been using the product.

Structuring the NPS survey this way helps the Zendesk team iso[1]late which teams influence the NPS and which actions correspond to positive and negative fluctuations. The first test chronologically establishes the positive impact of the marketing team on customers’ and prospects’ perceptions of Zendesk. The second survey establishes the happiness of the customer immediately after purchasing the product, and the product team’s effectiveness in developing the right on-boarding experience. The third NPS measures ongoing satisfaction and whether the product has met the customer’s expectations over time, again measuring marketing and sales.

If NPS spikes right after the sale and falls during the third survey, this is a sign the customer has been oversold—the company has overpromised the customer and these expectations haven’t been fulfilled, which could rapidly weaken the word-of-mouth growth of the product. Structuring NPS surveys this way enables Zendesk to measure customer satisfaction through the buyer journey and isolate the effects of different teams

**Favourite line :** Brutal intellectual honesty aims to slay the HIPPO, or the highest[1]paid person’s opinion, as the determining factor of the direction of a project, team, or company. Left unmitigated, this management artefact wreaks disastrous consequences on companies.

**Recruitment**

Instead of slapdash interactions in the name of interviews, Adam Grant advocates companies employ a clear, structured process:

1. Establish the characteristics of the ideal candidate at the outset of a search process.

2. Before the team interviews candidates, the hiring manager and the recruiter write questions that will establish whether a candidate embodies those characteristics.

3. The interviewing team scores each candidate on a consistent numerical scale across these attributes.

4. The candidate with the highest aggregate score is hired

Mis-hires, hiring people who aren’t a good fit for a role, can cost a company between 14 and 28 times the employee’s base salary, calculating the time spent recruiting the person, the opportunity cost of not hiring a better candidate, the costs of transitioning the person out of the company, and the costs of hiring a replacement.

**five strategic recruiting metrics:**

1. Qualified candidates (QCs): QC is defined as a phone interview that qualifies a candidate as a good fit for a job requisition. The QC is a leading indicator of whether the team will attain its hiring goals. By understanding the ratio of QC to accepted offer rate over time, a company can forecast the odds of attaining its hiring goal that quarter, just as sales teams estimate bookings. QC metrics answer questions like: How is the recruiting team developing a large candidate pipeline? Which candi[1]date acquisition channels work best? How much does it cost for the company to hire a candidate?
2. Days to close: Speed is a competitive advantage in recruiting, because the most sought-after candidates typically have many competing offers. Greenhouse maintains less than 30 days of latency between first contact and signed offer.
3. Candidate satisfaction: After every interview, Greenhouse sends a survey to candidates to gauge their satisfaction with the process, including how well the position was explained, how well prepared the interviewers were, and whether they felt respected and were treated courteously. The top businesses attain a satisfaction rate of 70 percent or better.
4. Offer acceptance rate: What fraction of people who receive offers accept them? This figure should be quite high, 75 percent, or greater in some cases. If the offer acceptance rate is low, the recruit[1]ing team should investigate. Some causes include lower candisatisfaction, an unduly long hiring cycle, unclear hiring parameters in the job requisition, and miscommunication between recruiting and hiring managers.
5. Hires to goal: Divide the total number of new hires by the hiring goal. If a company isn’t achieving its hires-to-goal number, it should investigate the obstacles, whether in sourcing talent, in the evaluation process, or in the actual offer. This metric raises these questions: Is the recruiting team consistently able to hire people according to the board-approved hiring plan? If not, what can be done to put the team back on track? Where in the recruiting funnel is the team challenged? Is it qualified candidates? Is it the conversion rate from telephone screens to in-person interviews? Or could it be the offer acceptance rate? What are the implications for compensation structure?

In addition, these metrics inform a company’s financial planning. If a business has a benchmark for the performance of its recruiting team, the company can understand precisely the number of increased recruiters necessary to attain the year’s hiring goals.

**How to define culture in a company?**

To define a culture, follow these steps.

First, assign a culture lead, often a key member of the manage[1]ment team. The lead solicits feedback from current employees about what they like and don’t like about working at the company, either by interviews or surveys.

Then, the culture lead condenses feedback into an initial set of values to be reviewed by the management team. The values should most strongly reflect the positives of the business, but they should also include some aspirational values to slowly evolve the culture of the company in a positive direction.

Next, the culture lead and management team present this first draft of values to the rest of the company and begin a back-and-forth dialogue. This interactive refinement process continues until consen[1]sus is reached that the values written down truly reflect the way employees feel about the company.

Last, the values become an integral component of the interview and recruiting process for new people. They form the basis of a series of structured interview questions meant to gauge the person’s val[1]ues and how strongly aligned he is with the rest of the employee population.

At Google, we called the collection of these values Googliness. Laszlo Bock, chief people officer at Google, described a Googley person as “curious, quick-learning generalists who can master what[1]ever challenges are thrown at them.

To determine cultural fit at Google, we asked behavioral questions. Behavioral interview questions test values best. If your company prizes customer-centricity in account executives, invite candidates, “Tell me about a time when you went out of your way to help a customer.” After they’ve responded, follow up with, “Now tell me about a second time.” Candidates who truly do embody customer-centricity shouldn’t be challenged by these questions, and the cultural fit will become clear

**Behavioral interview questions can be hard to develop. They take a lot of effort and thinking. So, Google’s talent team developed qDroid, a website for interviewers to find incisive behavioral questions. An interviewer logs into qDroid and enters the role he will be interviewing for, and qDroid provides questions he should ask in the interview that are highly correlated with a candidate’s success in the role. This database is constantly being updated and the questions improved.**

**What do teams value?**

Teams that know how to code would want ‘write once use everywhere’ type of code that they need to modify less. The other teams like marketing, sales etc  would want ease of use, beautiful visualizations etc.
