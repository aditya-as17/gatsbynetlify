History is replete with great men who self-educated themselves. Reasons are immatrial. For some it was a business decision, for some, traditional education methods could not satisfy their requirement, some had no other option or some just loved to learn. Nevertheless, the habit of self learning played a crucial role in cementing their place in history books. 

Now I have stressed enough on the importance of self-learning. Let's get on to How to do it well.

The hard part of understanding a new subject is trying to follow the interaction of several topics and many variables, as the current complex nature of things in our world constitute a quite formidable system. How can you ensure that you will progress efficiently and with some ease? The most important thing is to ask questions. **Ask your- self, as you follow an argument: Why is it that this or that variable should affect, say, aggregate demand? What would happen if it did not? What is the critical link?**

There is no substitute whatsoever for active learning. Are there simple rules for active study? The best way to study is to use pencil and paper and work through each argument by drawing diagrams, experimenting with flowcharts, writing out the logic of the argument, working out the problems, and underlining key ideas. Another valuable approach is to take issue with an argument or position or to spell out the defense for a particular view on questions that require opinions. Beyond that, if you get stuck, read on for half a page. If you are still stuck, go back five pages.

Remember, you can never master a subject in 1 or 2 reading. You have to devote time and effort for knowledge compounding to kick in. First reading is like reconnaissance, so get the lay of the land, understand what you can but move swiftly. It's the second reading which needs to be exhaustive, working through problems, summarizing the text and so on.

Economics, Computer Science, Physics, Math are all tough subjects but mastering them, is the only way to remain relevant in this era of Artificial Intelligence. Else your wealth and knowledge would be as flimsy as whatever's trending on social media.
