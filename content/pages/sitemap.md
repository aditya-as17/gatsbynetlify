We live in an era where bite sized information, in the form of instagram stories, tiktok videos or tweets with no background etc, shape our understanding and viewpoint. It has made the world polar, hostile, deteriorated our attention span and ability to focus.

This website has been created to preserve and promote long form reading, writing, creating. It will also serve as a base to me and a repository of my ideas and experimentation. This page is a map to maximize your benefit from this website.
