# About me
This section is a bit long and is the culmination of years of introspection, these traits I have. This is the reason 
- I am passionate about building no frills products and utilities which although have less functionality, very less pretty but do their core job fabulously, are cost leaders, can be rapidly  deployed and adaptable to changing needs.
- This approach runs into my life as well. I don't do optionals,  single-task at a time, cull tasks ruthlessly to focus on those that affect the bottom-line and transition quickly in roles to suit the requirement (perks of being exposed to different environments). 
- I am anything but a perfectionist. Quick decision and implementation that gives 80% results with minimal effort is my default goto strategy. 
- Unit economics run automatically in my brain if something requires investment in terms of my time. money, effort or attention. _Don't worry I am not that cold. Emotional events are factored in calculation too._
- I am comfortable working long hours if and only if it adds value to me or my reporting manager and my basic needs are taken care of. When I say working, it means making progress not just having my eyes open like a zombie with brain numb. If that happens, I sign out. I do not work for work's sake.
- I NEVER jeopardise nutrition, exercise and sleep due to work or mood. These very things make one able to perform at an optimum level and compromising it is analogous to 'killing the goose that lays golden eggs'.
- My life revolves around learning and implementing. Daily learning is ingrained in my lifestyle like brushing. I review tons of information but <5% make the cut to be in my learning schedule. Not because some things are useless to learn but because time is very limited and if not prioritised, will yield ZERO results.
    - Once Jakob Greenfeld told me, "The most important thing is to focus on just-in-time learning instead of just-in-case learning. 
    - It's usually impossible to know in advance what kind of knowledge will be useful. Hence the most effective strategy is to just do the thing you want to do and figure everything out along the way."
    - I govern my learnings through this perspective.
- I am long-term focused for my results. I can go years without losing momentum to work. The only thing in short term I care about is me working and learning every single day as per the plan and have no problem in throwing out all the work out of the window if it is defunct.
- Always wanted to join military, appeared twice every year after clearing written exam since 2015 but failed the interview every-time.
    - However, my eagerness to join military made me physically fit, mentally resilient and disciplined.
    - I am able to focus on tasks even in the midst of emotional turmoil, as if I'm in a sandbox environment.
    - If something is to be done, it will be done. Mood swings DO NOT stop me from doing what is due. 
    - I become cautious and avoid taking decisions when elated or sad so that my mood does not bias my decisions.

## Interests
The areas that I am currently concerned with, have been chosen after great deliberation and align with my disposition that well that even when I am on vacation, I make sure to have time for deep thinking over new issues related to business and technology or finding link between other subjects with former ones. 

So, In a nutshell, what interests me is - any piece of information related to any subject which has the potential to improve the current method by at least a factor of 10 be it in the terms of time saved or decrease in effort or a cost differential.

Apart from this, I have been involved in debating and oration since my college days. I, along with my friend, even opened up a public speaking platform - Sakshatkar. **This website is the extension of Sakshatkar's vision of sharing knowledge and best practices of the leaders with people from all walks of life.**
> Although, I really love to be engaged in my own acts of reading, writing, coding but If there's an opportunity to interact with people or praise them for their work or travel, I take it with both hands. These activities ensure that I remain a human and don't transform into a cyborg of Skynet AI.
